# Debugger Guide Report

## Abstract

This report presents a guide to mastering the debugger in Virtual Studio Code.
It is aimed at beginners and intermediate users, it provides step-by-step instructions from installation to advanced debugging techniques such as configuring a launch.json file and using breakpoints.
The guide goes through the practical application of key debugger functions like 'Step Over', 'Step Into', 'Step Out', and others, with the goal of improving the efficiency of bug identification and resolution for the user. 
It also covers the setup process, a detailed look at debugging commands, and tips on utilizing VS Code's debugging capabilities to their fullest. 
The goal is to explain the basic functionalities to help new users understand this and reinforce the understand of more experienced users.
Hopefully by the end of going through this, users will be able to swiftly and effectively troubleshoot code in a variety of programming scenarios.

## Reflection

Compiling this guide was not really challenging but very useful. 
I have tried to use the debugger in the past but before I was confused while using it and I kept on putting off taking the time to really understand it. 
This build badge gave me the opportunity and motivation to understand how it works and create a tool for both myself to practice with as well as additional users to use. 
The primary challenge lay in combining multiple resources on common debugger steps into a quick and concise defintion written in user-friendly language suitable for a wide audience.
Throughout this process, I gained valuable insights into different aspects of debugging, such as the strategic use of breakpoints and the differences between various stepping commands. 
Overall, this was a really useful topic to explore. 
I found myself utilizing the guide I wrote both while working on a personal project as well as a CSC 412 lab that was centered around the debugger. 
Had I not written this guide, I would have been much less efficient in both of these scenarios.
